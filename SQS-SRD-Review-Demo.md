# **AWS Security Requirements Document (SRD) for SQS**

This document aligns **Amazon SQS security best practices** with **NIST 800-53** controls to ensure AWS security compliance. Terraform configurations have been integrated to enforce the recommended security policies and controls.

## **SQS Queue Policy Permissions**

### **Description:** 
- Ensure SQS queue policies adhere to the principle of least privilege. 
### **Rationale:**
- Overly permissive queue policies can allow unauthorized access and potential data leakage.  

### **Recommendations:**
- **Use IAM policies** to restrict access to only necessary users and services. *(NIST AC-6: Least Privilege)*
- **Implement condition-based policies** (e.g., IP allow lists, VPC endpoints). *(NIST AC-3: Access Enforcement)*
- **Regularly audit SQS policies** using IAM Access Analyzer. *(NIST CA-7: Continuous Monitoring)*
- **Terraform Implementation:**
  - IAM role policies explicitly define least privilege access.
  - Secure transport enforced via `aws:SecureTransport` condition in IAM.

## **SQS Queue Cost Optimization**

### **Description:** 
- Evaluate the use of SQS for cost optimization.  

### **Rationale:** 
- Efficient use of SQS can reduce costs associated with message processing and storage.  

### **Recommendations:**
- **Enable Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs)** to avoid unnecessary reprocessing. *(NIST SI-4: System Monitoring)*
- **Use long polling** instead of short polling to minimize API calls. *(NIST SC-5: Resource Availability)*
- **Consider using S3 for long-term message storage** instead of keeping messages in SQS. *(NIST MP-6: Media Sanitization for retention control)*
- **Terraform Implementation:**
  - DLQ enabled for failed messages.
  - Long polling configured in `aws_sqs_queue` resource.

## **SQS Queue Monitoring and Alerts**

### **Description:** 
- Set up monitoring and alerts for SQS queue metrics.  

### **Rationale:**
- Monitoring helps detect anomalies, performance issues, and operational problems in queue processing.  

### **Recommendations:**
- **Enable Amazon CloudWatch metrics for SQS.** *(NIST AU-12: Audit Generation)*
- **Set up CloudWatch alarms** for high queue depth, age of oldest message, and API throttling. *(NIST SI-4: System Monitoring)*
- **Enable AWS Config rules** to monitor policy compliance and encryption settings. *(NIST CA-7: Continuous Monitoring)*
- **Terraform Implementation:**
  - CloudWatch alarms configured for queue monitoring.
  - AWS Config enabled for security compliance tracking.

## **SQS Queue Data Transfer Monitoring**

### **Description:**
- Monitor data transfer costs associated with SQS queues.  

### **Rationale:**
- Understanding data transfer patterns helps manage costs and optimize network usage.  

### **Recommendations:**
- **Use VPC endpoints for SQS** to avoid unnecessary public data transfer costs. *(NIST SC-7: Boundary Protection)*
- **Analyze data transfer logs** to identify patterns and optimize usage. *(NIST AU-6: Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting)*
- **Consider message batching** to reduce API call frequency and associated costs. *(NIST SC-5: Resource Availability)*
- **Terraform Implementation:**
  - VPC endpoints configured for private SQS communication.
  - AWS CloudTrail logs enabled for audit tracking.

## **SQS Queue Policy Compliance**

### **Description:**
- Validate that SQS queue policies comply with security best practices.  

### **Rationale:**
- Ensuring policy compliance helps maintain security and operational integrity of SQS queues.  

### **Recommendations:**
- **Enforce encryption using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).** *(NIST SC-12: Cryptographic Key Establishment & Management)*
- **Require message signing** for sensitive workloads. *(NIST SC-13: Cryptographic Protection)*
- **Implement AWS Security Hub and AWS Config** to ensure continuous compliance. *(NIST CA-7: Continuous Monitoring)*
- **Terraform Implementation:**
  - KMS encryption enforced for all SQS messages.
  - Security Hub integration for real-time compliance monitoring.
